  <h1>Snapper and Squirtle - The Happy Texas Map Turtles</h1>

  <p>My twin and I got Snapper and Squirtle on our 10th birthday! They were delivered in a little box on a super snowy
    day and luckily didn't have any injuries. Snapper and Squirtle are Texas Map Turtles, and
    can live over 40 years. They have a special map-like pattern on their shells, which is how they got their names.
  </p>

  <p>
    When we got them, they were only a few inches long, and are now 7-8 inches in shell length after 15 years. Before
    they arrived, we had to prepare their aquatic tank. We bought a piece of aquatic wood, a rectangular shaped heater,
    a water filter and the corresponding carbon filters, a few thermometers to double check the water temperature, a
    bunch of turtle food, as well as heat lamps for them to bask under.
  </p>

  <p>We had a DNA test done to make sure one was female and one was male, and although they lay eggs a few times
    per year, we don't think the eggs are fertile. Surprisingly, they eat their own eggs.
    We've tried taking the eggs out once they are laid and putting them in an incubator, but they still wouldn't hatch.
  </p>

  <p> We clean the tank filter once every couple weeks by siphoning the water out into large buckets. We then refill
    the tank with clean water to match their original water temperature. While we siphon the water off, we also scrub
    off the extra algae buildup on the sides of the tanks.
    We feed them a few teaspoons of turtle food every other day, and Squirtle is often very happy when we feed her (or
    go near her). She will splash water for minutes on end, as if trying to jump out of the water to say hi! She has
    broken way too many of the heat lamps by splashing water on it.
  </p>
